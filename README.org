#+TITLE: Gigabyte Monitor control

* Introduction

A CLI tool to change monitor settings over USB to the Gigabyte M32U

* Supported monitors
- Gigabyte M32U


In theory any Gigabyte Monitor that uses a Realtek HID device to control it over
OSD sidekick *should* have the same protocol, but this is the only one I own


* To install:

You'll need libhidapi and libudev -- on Debians that's ~apt install libhidapi-dev libudev-dev~

#+begin_src sh
go install github.com/kelvie/gbmonctl@latest
#+end_src

* To use:

#+begin_example
~ ~/go/bin/gbmonctl -h                                                                                                                    0 [20:42:49]
Usage of /home/kelvie/go/bin/gbmonctl:
  -n    Dry run: test commands and print instead
  -p int
        Property to set, 16 is brightness, 18 is contrast, 137 is sharpness (default 16)
  -v int
        Value to set it to (0-100 for brightness and contrast, 1-10 for sharpness) (default 50)
#+end_example

Examples:
#+begin_src sh
# Set brightness to 50
gbmonctl -p 16 -v 50

# Set contrast to 50
gbmonctl -p 18 -v 50

# Set sharpness to 5
gbmonctl -p 137 -v 5
#+end_src

I don't recommend using values that are out of the ranges listed, and this
program doesn't check, so I'm not liable for monitor damage that occurs from
this.

* TODO
- Get the rest of the commands
- Make more user friendly
- validate ranges
